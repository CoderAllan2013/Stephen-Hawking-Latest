        <p>Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 - 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist,
            and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology
            at the University of Cambridge.Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the
            University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Hawking studied physics at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1962), and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Ph.D.,
            1966). He was elected a research fellow at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge. In the early 1960s
            Hawking contracted amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable degenerative neuromuscular disease. He
            continued to work despite the disease’s progressively disabling effects.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Hawking worked primarily in the field of general relativity and particularly on the physics of black holes.
            In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects containing as much as one
            billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton. These objects, called mini black holes, are
            unique in that their immense mass and gravity require that they be ruled by the laws of relativity, while
            their minute size requires that the laws of quantum mechanics apply to them also. In 1974 Hawking proposed
            that, in accordance with the predictions of quantum theory, black holes emit subatomic particles until they
            exhaust their energy and finally explode. Hawking’s work greatly spurred efforts to theoretically delineate
            the properties of black holes, objects about which it was previously thought that nothing could be known.
            His work was also important because it showed these properties’ relationship to the laws of classical
            thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.
